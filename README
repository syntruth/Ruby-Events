This is a very simplistic events callback library in Ruby. Simplistic in the
fact that it does no threading or any sort of process management; it's meant
more for very simple projects that can benefit from an event observation
model.  I've mostly used it in an IRC bot that's in the process of being 
written.

This is a stand-alone lib, with no requirements.  Full docs are in docs/
of course.

Here's a simple example:

  require "events"

  create_event(:laugh)

  has_event?(:event)
    => false
  has_event?(:laugh)
    => true

  observe_event(:laugh) do |event, who|
    puts "%s is laughing!" % who
  end

  emit_event(:laugh, "Syntruth")
    => Syntruth is laughing!

  observe_event(:laugh) do |event, who|
    puts "Somebody is laughing!"
  end

  emit_event(:laugh, "Syntruth")
    => Syntruth is laughing!
    => Somebody is laughing!
